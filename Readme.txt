To Install:

1) Import aliases.xml into the Mushclient World you want to use this plugin with
2) Install the plugin in GMCP.unveiler folder

Usage:
So far, I have only tested using the plugin for keeping track of afflictions and defences.
The plugin will create gmcp.my_affs and gmcp.my_defs Lua tables in your world script space and update them based on GMCP messages received.
